# cohost better notifications!

this is a chrome extension to make your cohost notifications more readable. it collapses the likes, follows, and shares (without additional posts) into a separate column, so you can look at your comments, replies, and shares (with additional posts) at one glance :)

it's really bodgy. but it seems to work right now. who knows?

## install instructions
1. download **cohost-better-notifications.zip** from the right under **releases**
2. unzip it
3. go to chrome://extensions if you're on chrome, and opera:extensions if you're on opera
4. turn on **developer mode** (top right)
5. click **load unpacked** and select the unzipped extension you downloaded
6. it's installed!
7. open your extensions menu and click on 'cohost better notifications'. toggle the 'enable' switch.
8. see it in action at your [notifications page](https://cohost.org/rc/project/notifications)!

## things which it's not really good at
- when you click 'load more' on your notifications, you gotta click 'reload' on the sidebar. sorryy.
- if you have a new notification that's grouped with one of the sidebar notifs, it won't tell you which is the new one. just gotta kinda figure it out. (this aligns to the 'don't care about like count' core of cohost, doesn't it?)
- can't click on the sidebar to go to the post. sorry ! i tried really hard but couldn't do it. if you can do it feel free to make a pull request or anything. or just make a better version
- it's a little bit of a mess, so if cohost updates the notifications page it might just fall apart.
